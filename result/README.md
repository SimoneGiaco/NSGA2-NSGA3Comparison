# Results obtained

The NSGA2vsNSGA3.pdf file contains an extensive report about my findings and the metric obtained during the 10 testing runs. The file has been generated from the corresponding tex file which I attach. The data and figures are taken from the attached NSGA2vsNSGA3.ipynb notebook. The notebook has been created and executed with Google Colab (CPU in the free tier) and includes execution times for the various problems considered. 

The results clearly show that as we increase the number of objectives NSGAIII performs better than NSGAII.
